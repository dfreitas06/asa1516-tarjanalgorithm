# Tarjan Algorithm

### Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms - 1st Project

This project consists in developing an algorithm, in a programming language of our choice, that solves the problem following problem:

*The diffusion of informations in social networks happens through the communication between users. When a person receives an information which she considers interesting, she shares that information to those she knows. As all people can share, the information can be transmited to all people on the network.
There can exist people who are fundamental in the transmission of information. A person p is considered fundamental if the only way for the transmission of information between person r and s necessarily goes through p (where p is not r nor s). Your task is to identify which people are fundamental in a network.*

The chosen language for our algorithm was C++ and as the title indicates the algorithm we deemed appropriate to solve this problem was the Tarjan Algorithm.
